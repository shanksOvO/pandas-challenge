    "Impact of School Size:\n",
    "* According to the data, larger schools often have lower passing rates than smaller schools. In smaller schools, there is a tendency for a higher percentage of pupils to pass the math, reading, and overall exams. This shows that smaller schools could offer pupils a more supportive atmosphere for learning and individualized attention, improving academic achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact of School Budget:\n",
    "\n",
    "* According to the data, there is an correlation between school budget and passing rates, with lower budgets all around being associated with greater passing rates in math, reading, and general performance. This suggests that these schools may have employed successful tactics, made efficient use of the resources at their disposal, or prioritized particular areas of instruction that have favorably impacted student progress despite having minimal financial resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Impact of School District:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The analysis of school districts indicates that charter schools often do better academically than district schools. Charter schools regularly have higher passing rates in areas like math and reading, as well as overall, according to the results by school type. This implies that charter schools' unique traits and pedagogical strategies could be responsible for their superior performance to district schools. To better understand the causes of this discrepancy and to pinpoint potential best practices that district schools may use to improve their performance, more study is required."
